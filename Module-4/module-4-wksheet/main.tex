\section{Intro}
You have your question and plenty of backup ideas, as well a much better understanding of the field, existing research landscape, and cool directions. Now we're going to figure out exactly how to answer that question. 

We're putting everything together now, and by the end of this worksheet you will have a full blown research proposal that you can continue through I2 (and I hope you all do!), or you will have the experience and skills to thoroughly begin other research avenues. 

I encourage you all to dream about the impacts of your research and to obsessively worry about possible negative side effects. What change do you want to make? How will you get there?

And, as always, you should do this worksheet WITH YOUR TEAM! Look at the sun! It's out there these days! Go meet in the quad or something.

\section{Research Proposal Template}
For the following sections, if you do not yet have a fully formed answer for the section, note what knowledge you are missing in order to answer the question and how you can find that knowledge!

My friend chugged a Monster and drove half the night and I woke up at 5 somewhere on the border of Oregon and California and took over. We had to get back to let his dog out...}
