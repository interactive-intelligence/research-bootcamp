# I2 Research Project Bootcamp Syllabus

Prerequisites: Intro to Neuro/AI course or similar experience with ML or neuroscience concepts.
The due dates listed under assignments are the dates the tasks are *due by*, not started on.

This is a **team-based** research project formulation bootcamp that will ensure the research you spend your time on is worthwhile and doable!

    - Explanation of desired outcome of research process (1-2 paragraphs)

### Assignments

- Research/learn about the *backbone* of your chosen subfields

## Module 2: Research Focus Selection Fortnight
### 04/14 - 04/21, [CHECKPOINT]
### 04/21 - 04/28

### Purpose
- Select a topic from the the ones previously researched **as a group**
- Dive deep into the chosen topic with the goal of **finding a research question to create a project on**
  - Note that if you find after reading more that you want to switch topics, this is totally fine and why we had you research more than one initially
- Create a presentation to show to all of i2!

### Resources

- Subfield lock-in Google Sheet **[TODO]**
- Group Research LaTeX Worksheet **[TODO]**
  - Brainstorm 10 research questions you would be interested in
  - Find 3 relevant or interesting researchers and fill in their contact info
  - Assign one paper for members to read by next week
- Subfield Presentation Guide/Specification **[TODO]**

### Assignment

Due 04/21
- Select one of the topics from the two you previously researched
  - Present on that topic to your group
- After presentations, select a research focus from the topics to create your research project

Due 04/28
- Further read any prerequisite topics for your chosen research topic
- Create **presentation on research focus** to present to i2 during the next meeting

---

## Module 3: Crafting a Question Fortnight
### 04/28 - 05/05, 
### 05/05 - 05/12

Here we will begin to formalize your project direction by choosing a specific research question.

### Purpose

- Formalize plan of attack
- Ensure important project success metrics:
  - Provable viability
  - Provable impact
- Determine if your idea has been done before (not immediately a bad thing!) 

### Resources

- Viability and Impact LaTeX Document **[TODO]**
- Importance of Hypothesis Formulation Presentation **[TODO]**
- Researcher Contact Template **[TODO]**

### Assignment

- Once again, list possible research questions (at least 5)
- Fill out **Viability and Impact LaTeX Document** for top 3-5 questions
- Meet with your group **in person** at least **once**
  - Rank your research questions
  - Write out possible prototypes, experiments, and methods to answering this questions
  - Contact at least one researcher, present your ideas, and ask for their thoughts and feedback
  - **Select your final question that will be used in your research project proposal**
   - You won't get immediate replies from researchers, so don't wait for their feedback to choose your question, but you're free to change course once you have heard back and have a better perspective!
---

## Module 4: Making your Proposal
### 05/12 - 05/19

We can no longer provide an **exact** framework for what you need to do, but if you made it this far and have completed all the assignments,
you will not need bumper rails anymore! You're on your own in terms of project direction, but don't
forget that you're still in the middle of a group of very smart and capable people who want to
help you!

### Purpose

- Create an official research proposal!

### Resources

- Project Proposal Examples and Slideshow **[TODO]**
- Project Proposal Template (NSF) **[TODO]**

### Assignment

- Create your **project proposal!**

---

## Module -1: What's Next?
### 05/19 - End of Quarter (EOQ)
Although your project may not be (probably is not) completely finished, we will take a moment to summarize what you've
accomplished so far, present to others, and get feedback from all of i2. You can discuss how your research has been going.
It isn't always smooth, and we don't expect that you follow a linear path along this course. Along the way, you may have
decided to pivot, reverse course, take up a completely different topic altogether, or maybe you found the perfect one from 
the start. No matter where you're at, we want to discuss it!

### Purpose
- Present progress, challenges, and knowledge gained / lessons learned
- Choose a future direction!
- Delegate work and get started!

### Resources

- Final Research Presentation Specification **[TODO]**

### Assignment

Due by EOQ
- Final research project presentation and update
