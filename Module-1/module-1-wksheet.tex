\section{Intro}
This worksheet will help you explore various topics you generated last week in more depth and guide you towards choosing a research topic that is meaningful to you.
\subsection{Why Research Anything?}
Before we begin, I want you to spend a little bit thinking about why you are in this particular place spending your time on this particular activity. Write a paragraph or more about what you want to see as a result of taking on this intellectual challenge, about what is important to you, and how being here and participating in this relates. Maybe you don't know all the answers yet. As long as you have questions that's ok. Honestly, I never stop asking these questions. I never arrive at one answer, but I feel like I continually respond to them as I keep living. Have fun with it!

\item \textbf{WITH YOUR TEAM} Meet (Discord or in person) and summarize the topic that you explored. What was the most interesting?
