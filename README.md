## Overview
Before we get started, I want to take a minute to think about all that the wrinkly, electric neuron blob in your skull is capable of. We humans like to think of ourselves as different and special. Homo sapiens have been around for about 160,000 years, which for a species, is kind of chump change. Nematodes, microscopic worms that collectively weigh about 400 million tons and outnumber humans by 57 billion to 1, are about 400 million years old. We aren’t the most populous species. We aren’t the most evolutionarily successful species. We aren’t the oldest species. Are we really special? Well in the past archaeological millisecond, 10,000 years since discovering the cultivation of wheat, humans have colonized the globe and manipulated the Earth’s resources on geologic scales. No other species has moved so quickly or changed so much. Although we must keep a humble perspective as we see the vast expanse of life that surrounds and precedes us, there is something special about the particular structure and coordination of our electric neuron blobs that created the capability of unprecedented change and discovery. 

The research this course is designed to focus on is how we can recreate and understand this quality, using the best tools we have today across disciplines like computer science, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy and more. I believe that it is necessary to understand ourselves and our impact that we are making on the world in order to keep the parts of it we love around. And I believe that studying intelligence with more accessibility and interdisciplinarity is a part of this understanding.

Welcome to the Interactive Intelligence Research Bootcamp! I’m excited you’re here.

## Expectations
If you have not already done so, join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Ph8njzHedC 
Make sure you have selected Member in the #roles-react channel
Attend at least 75% of meetings on Fridays at 5pm - 6pm, in Sieg Hall Room 233
Complete the assignments to the best of your ability and stay on track to the best of your ability
We will make you collaborate. In person! And it will make you a better researcher
Communicate with your group and instructors or TAs when you are falling behind or not able to complete assignments – we are here to help!

## Resources
The entire course is contained on Github and your go to source for information, assignments, worksheets and more will be found in the schedule.md syllabus, here:
Research Project Bootcamp Github 

While all other resources can be found from the Github README, I will list a few more core resources here.

All the slides for the quarter will be found here:

## Results
By the end of this course, you will have
Explored many different avenues and subfields of intelligence research at large
Read and presented cutting edge academic papers in these fields
Formulated a thorough, novel research question
Deep-dived into the field surrounding your research question
Created a research proposal and begun to prototype

All of these accomplishments are extremely important for a career in research, but more importantly this is a way to collaboratively create and explore intelligence research that you’re passionate about. At the end, if you have followed through with the assignments each week, you will have a well-developed idea, and you will have the option to continue your research project as a part of i2! Once again, I believe the world needs people who care about understanding why we do what we do and the changes we are making. I am excited to help you explore and see what you come up with!
